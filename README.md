# Catch a Match: Student Quiz Matching Tool

Welcome to "Catch a Match," where we turn quiz responses into unexpected connections! This tool analyzes quiz answers from MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering For Women to pair participants based on answer similarities. Developed for Gandhaar, our college festival, in collaboration with the Wings Magazine Club.

## Project Description

Ever wondered who thinks like you? This project dives into student responses, using clever algorithms to uncover similarities between classmates' answers. Whether it's uncovering quiz twins or surprising matches, expect insights and connections that spark curiosity.

## Key Features

- **Cosine Similarity Analysis:** Crunches text data using CountVectorizer and cosine similarity to find kindred spirits in the quiz realm.
- **Jaccard Similarity Analysis:** Plays matchmaker by comparing answer sets with the Jaccard indexâ€”perfect for discovering unexpected quiz alliances.
- **Visualize Connections:** Opt for a fun network graph visualization (using NetworkX and Matplotlib) to see how classmates connect through their quiz answers.
- **Get Results:** Discover the quirkiest quiz duos with outputs that range from friendly console prints to structured tables (thanks to PrettyTable).
